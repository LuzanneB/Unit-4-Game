// Create a variable called randomNumber to equal a random number between 1-100 and
    // Show value in #randomNumber
// Create a variable called crystal1, crystal2, crystal3,crystal4 all to random # between 1-100.
// Create a variable called totalScore equal to 0.
// Create a variable called wins equal to 0
// Create a variable called losses equal to 0
// Create a function to reset randomNumber, crystal1-4, totalScore
// Create click event, so that when crystal images are clicked the current value of crystal adds to the totalScore value 
    // if the totalScore is less than randomNumber, update #totalScore with totalScore
    // if the totalScore is more than randomNumber,
        // +1 to losses variable and update #losses
        // run reset function created above
    // if the totalScore is equal to randomNumber
        // +1 to wins variable and update #wins
        // run reset function created above
